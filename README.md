# mechanics-waves
1st year mechanics and waves worksheets using Python notebooks.

The objective is to have a physics-motivated introduction to programming.
This means the order of topics is not the usual one for a regular introduction to programming.

For instance, I teach Numpy arrays and slicing before "for" loops.
